Here I will be exploring the world of smart contracts with solidity making a few test contracts for an imaginary company. I will be creating three contracts that all split profits in different ways. All the contracts will be found here in the repo as .sol files. The contracts will also be deployed on test networks and the address will be found below with the respective contract so you can interact with it if you would like. Enjoy !

**Contract 1:** Associate Profit Splitter (***AssociateProfitSplitter.sol***) This contract will accept Ether and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees I have deployed it on the Kovan Test Network. (***Contract Address: 0x60420892B5bCb2a94215afeD6194932Ec3bBB9ED***)

**Contract 2:** Tiered Profit Splitter (***TieredProfitSplitter.sol***) This contract will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%. (***Contract Address: 0xC73Bd893bAcDaA385ADD6B45fDFcc09Ef13D937F***)

**Contract 3:** Deferred Equity Plan (***DeferredEquityPlan.sol***) This contract will model traditional company stock plans. It will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee. (***Contract Address: 0x317647096BA97C9d5E09A61D7530668ccC219dd6***)
